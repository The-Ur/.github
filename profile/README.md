From the makers of ArgueBot, The Ur provides an Amazon marketplace for a holographic world 
layered on top of the physical -- this is the AR metaverse.

> We are creating two technologies for two marketplaces that haven't even been 
created yet -- and almost every industry will rely on our innovations
to solve their current problems.

The Ur allows users to create their own worlds and integrate with others' imaginary 
worlds: visit friends' rooms with toys to interact with, grocery store containing 
virtual signs and information, amusements parks in empty grass plot lands, and dragons 
in boring play structures. 

The Ur provides this technology through both software and hardware: from machine learning 
computer vision to communicative positional hardware using advanced algorithms.
